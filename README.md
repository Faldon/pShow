<h2>A simple slideshow app for Windows Phone 8.</h2>

<p>
Unsatisfied with the available slideshow apps for WP8, I decided to write my own.
</p>
<p>
Overview:
<br />
Displays the album name and a preview image for every picture album accessible through the media library in a 2-3 column wide, scrollable grid using a LongListSelector. Opening the desired album with a short click on it gives a preview of all images in the album. In this detail view, one can start the slideshow with a play button in the application bar.
On the album overview page, one can access the settings through the application bar, where several parameters could be set.
</p>
<p>
Current features are:
<ul>
<li>Adjustable display duration for each picture</li>
<li>Different sorting methods for the album picture position in the slideshow</li>
<li>Several selectable picture transitions</li>
<li>Works in landscape and portrait mode</li>
<li>Does not dim screen during slideshow</li>
<li>Ad-free</li>
</ul>
