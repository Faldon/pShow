A simple slideshow app for Windows Phone 8.

Unsatisfied with the available slideshow apps for WP8, I decided to write my own.

Overview:
Displays the album name and a preview image for every picture album accessible through the media library in a 3 column, scrollable grid. Opening the desired album with a short click on it gives a preview of all images in the album. In this detail view, one can start the slideshow with a play-like button in the application bar.
On the album overview page, one can access the settings through the application bar, where several parameters could be set.

Current features are:
-Adjustable display duration for each picture
-Different sorting methods for the album picture position in the slideshow
-Works in landscape and portrait mode
-Does not dim screen during slideshow
-Ad-free
